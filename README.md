# How to start the project

It is as simple as this: just run Application.java

# Initial test-endpoint

To test, whether it works correctly, after you have started Application.java, just call this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8080/greeting

If you see something like {"id":1,"content":"Hello, name!"}, then it's working correctly :)
